# EcoVision: Climate Visualizer

## Take-Home Assessment for Software Engineers

Hello! Welcome to our take home assessment. We think you might make a valuable addition to the Mutual of Omaha Mortgage engineering team. While we are looking for bright people to join our team, we also understand your time is valuable. Please limit the amount of work you put into the project to 2 hours. Of course, you can spend more time on it, but we're looking for creativity, productivity, documentation and a skilled command of modern tooling. Good luck and have fun!

## Project Overview

This project is designed to test your full-stack skills in Python, SQL and a bit of React by building an interactive climate data explorer. The EcoVision application will allow users to explore climate trends and patterns through an intuitive web interface, making complex environmental data accessible to everyone from scientists to students.

## Wow, a Backstory?

In 2023, the Global Climate Action Initiative partnered with leading research institutions to create a unified climate data repository. While the data is revolutionary, they lack an effective way to make this information accessible to the public. 

That's where you and your EcoVision project come in. The goal is build an minimum viable platform that transforms raw climate metrics into intuitive visuals anyone can understand! If this succeeds, who knows what change can be accomplished!

## Technical Requirements

You'll be building:

1. **Python Backend**: API endpoints to serve climate data and scripts to ingest and transform raw climate data
2. **SQL Database**: Store and query climate metrics
3. **JavaScript Frontend**: Wire up your api to the interactive dashboard with visualizations

## Technology Recommendations

You're free to use any libraries or frameworks you prefer, but here are some suggestions:

### Backend
- Python web framework like Flask or FastAPI
- MySQL (preferred for our stack) or SQLite

### Frontend
- Vanilla JavaScript or a framework like React
- Vite
- TailwindCSS 

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install your preferred dependencies
5. Run the development server according to your backend choice

## Assessment Tasks

1. Complete the API endpoints to serve climate data
2. Implement the database models and queries
3. Build the frontend dashboard with at least two different visualizations
4. Add filtering capabilities (by date range, location, etc.)
5. Document your approach, decisions, and code (arguably the most important part!)

## Time Expectation

This assessment is designed to take approximately 2 hours. Focus on functionality first, then improve the UI/UX if time permits.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality, creativity and organization
- Proper use of Git (commit messages, branch strategy)
- API design and implementation
- Database queries and data handling
- Documentation quality

## Bonus Criteria

- Ability to wire up the dashboard to the API
- Creativity in the display or unique solutions

## Resources

- Sample climate datasets are provided in the `data/` directory
- API endpoint specifications in `docs/api.md`
- Database basic requirements in `docs/schema.md`

## Submission

Create a public Git repository with your solution reply to this email with the link. You may include a brief explanation or video of your approach, any challenges you faced, and what you would improve given more time. 

## Final Notes

We'd like you to focus on the back-end aspect more-so than making a shiny front-end. We've included the boilerplate for the front-end, but if you had to pick between the two, please fully build out your Python and SQL areas first. Ultimately, since this assessment allows you to use whatever, however, we'll leave it all up to your discretion. 

Please have fun and good luck!
